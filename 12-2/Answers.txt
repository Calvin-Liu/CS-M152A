1) clk_en enables the clock since it is a sequential circuit.
The rising edge is the trigger and is necessary to determine the
next cycle of the circuit.This is why we toggle the clk every 5
miliseconds so it switches from high and low.

2)The period turns out to be 1.3107ms

3)Its 0

1)

2) 5.2439 ms

3) Even though clk_en and clk_en_d have the same value, the clk_en_d
has to execute later and thus the clock cycle has to be delayed.
It has to be done later because the step_d has to be executed 
first.

1) If the rst is set to 1, the for loop goes through each register
and sets it to 0. If the rst is not enabled, then the register file
specified by 2 bits, represented by i_wsel takes the data of
i_wdata. Then the output data is set for whenever the user wants
the data from the rf (register file).

2)    assign o_data_a = rf[i_sel_a];
   assign o_data_b = rf[i_sel_b];
   
This is combinational logic
